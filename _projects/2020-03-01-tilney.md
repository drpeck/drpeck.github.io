I began working with Tilney to rebuild their 4 Umbraco CMS websites, but they retained my services to take on a wider architect role and lead the development within the marketing team. Among the different tasks I performed for them are:
 - Re-shaped how they were attributing marketing activity to marketing spend
 - Build a Vue.JS [Investment Search](https://www.bestinvest.co.uk/investment-search) for Bestinvest
 - Rebuilt and maintained 4 Umbraco websites
